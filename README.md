   <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**TuDu** is a simple To-Do List Web App written in **React**, a JavaScript framework created by the smart folks at Facebook, it uses **Firebase** for authentication and **Cloud Firestore** for the database and some really cool packages powered by the npm and GitHub community.

## Used in this project

This project uses some very useful npm dependencies createad by the React community, here's which dependency is used and how to install:

### Bootstrap

[react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)

This package is needed to use Bootstrap with React, all components are available with minimal to no adjustments.

### Splash screen

[react-welcome-page](https://github.com/utarit/react-welcome-page)

This is used to create the awesome splashscreen you see when loading the app, it's fully customizable inside the `splashScreen` component, you can follow the likn's instruction.

### Color picker

[react-color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color/)

This is used to add the color picker to the app, it allows the user to change the card's background color. It's fully customizable, there's a lot of picker style to choose from.

### Date Picker

[react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/)

Use to set a time to a task, it'very customizable. Used with Moment.js to convert the date to a specific format.

### Firebase

[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

The application works thank to Firebase, the platform created by Google offers authentication via the major providers such as Google, Facebook GitHub and many others (i chose to use Google for ease of use). Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database.

### Moment.js

[react-moment](https://github.com/headzoo/react-moment)

Used to convert Firestore timestamps in legible format.

### Fontawesome

[react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)

Just some icons, nothing more, nothing less.

### React Router

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Using this package i can redirect the user to the right page based on whether he is loged or not.

[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

### Depcheck

[depcheck](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck)

Used to check the dependencies, remove the unused ones and install the missing ones.

## Features

This is a comprehensive list of all the features available in TuDu.

### Add Item

Simply type your task and press enter to add it to your table.

### Categories

When adding a new item you can add a category with this simple sintax:

> New Item Text #Category

The category will be shown in the header of your item.

### Item Management

You can set your items as completed by pressing on the ‚úîÔ∏è button or you can delete the item of your choice by pressing the üóëÔ∏è button.

### Colors

You can choose the card color of your liking by pressing the üé® button on the bottom right side of the card and select which color you want, you can even enter a Hex value!

### DateTime

You can set a date and time for the task by clicking on the ‚è∞ icon and choosing date and time, you can delete said date and time by clicking on the ‚úñ besides the date. When a date expires it will change color, loosing it's opacity.

## Authentication

Authentication is provided by Google Firebase, i chose to support only Google's own authentication. It can be customized to support Facebook, GitHub and many more.

## Database

I chose Cloud Firestore for the database, it's reliable, fast and cloud-based, which makes it perfect for a web-app. The data is stored securely on Google's servers.
