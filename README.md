   <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**TuDu** is a simple To-Do List Web App written in **React**, a JavaScript framework created by the smart folks at Facebook, it uses **Firebase** for authentication and **Cloud Firestore** for the database and some really cool packages powered by the npm and GitHub community.

## Installation

This project uses some very useful npm dependencies createad by the React community, here's which dependency is used and how to install:

### Bootstrap

[react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)

This package is needed to use Bootstrap with React, all components are available with minimal to no adjustments.

`npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

### Splash screen

[react-welcome-page](https://github.com/utarit/react-welcome-page)

This is used to create the awesome splashscreen you see when loading the app, it's fully customizable inside the `splashScreen` component, you can follow the likn's instruction.

`npm install --save react-welcome-page`

### Color picker

[react-color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color/)

This is used to add the color picker to the app, it allows the user to change the card's background color. It's fully customizable, there's a lot of picker style to choose from.

[react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/)

Use to set a time to a task, it'very customizable. Used with Moment.js to convert the date to a specific format.

### Firebase

[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

The application works thank to Firebase, the platform created by Google offers authentication via the major providers such as Google, Facebook GitHub and many others (i chose to use Google for ease of use). Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database.
